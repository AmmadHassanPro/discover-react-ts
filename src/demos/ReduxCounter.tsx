  // This function will be called any time the store is updated, mapStateToProps will be called. it will be supplied with the new state returned by the Reducer . So we are hanlding it by setting the value property to the new State
  //The return of the mapStateToProps determine whether the connected component will re-render
  const mapStateToProps = (state: {counter: number}) => ({
    value: state.counter, // The re-render will happen, by performing a shallow comparison of this value , Notice why were are calling it a prop? bcuz value is supplied at the component creation
  });
  //The results of mapStateToProps must be a plain object, which will be merged into the wrapped componentâ€™s props
  // in the Above example, value is returned in a plain object, after its returned , it will be merged aka included in the Counter Compoonents props, so when re-rednering the component, it will be provided to the componenet's props
  //E.G
  //function Counter({ value, increment, decrement }: CounterProps)  , notice that the Counter component is expecting a n object that also includes the value , so the returned value is merged into that
  

  // mapDispatchToProps is given the dispatch of the your store object. Basically, these are also merged with the Props provided to the components .
  // So the above return value and the properties in the below return object will be merged to form a prop. That prop will be provided to the component
  const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch: Dispatch) => ({
    increment: () => dispatch({type: 'INCREMENT'}),
    decrement: () => dispatch({type: 'DECREMENT'}),

  // Summary: The return value of the mapStateToProp and mapDispatchToProps , will be merged to form a Prop object which will be passed to the component , then component will utilize it. Simple!

  // Create a higher-order component ready to plug into a store
  // Inversion of control
  const ConnectedCounter = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps,)(Counter);

  const mapResetDispatchToProps = (dispatch : Dispatch) => ({reset: () => dispatch({type: 'RESET'})});
  // The first Paramter is provided as null, bcuz this component does not need to know when a state change is happened ,as this component has nothing to do with State
