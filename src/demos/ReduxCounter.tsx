/*
This code is a simple demonstration of , how two components can be using the same Redux store , 
using their own reducers , and sharing the same state. We have used reduce-reducers to take union 
of two reducers which acts on the same data.
However , the redux recommends that each Reducer should update only one slice of data of the state
and CombineReducers should be instead. It really depends on the use case.

  // in the Above example, value is returned in a plain object, after its returned , it will be merged aka included in the Counter Compoonents props, so when re-rednering the component, it will be provided to the componenet's props
  //E.G
  //function Counter({ value, increment, decrement }: CounterProps)  , notice that the Counter component is expecting a n object that also includes the value , so the returned value is merged into that
  

  // mapDispatchToProps is given the dispatch of the your store object. Basically, these are also merged with the Props provided to the components .
